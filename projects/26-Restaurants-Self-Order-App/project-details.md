#### How would you describe your project?

In the world of digitization, its a good idea if you entered a restaurant or a cafe and be able to complete your order by your mobile phone or tablet (it should work for both Dine-in and take away orders)
some restaurants and cafes today purchase systems with tablets (As menu) so they give them to customers whenever they dine-in, so why don't we make an app, or maybe a web app (for whoever don't want to install apps), where customers will navigate directly to the restaurant they are sitting in, and place and even checkout their order,

we can add both cryptocurrency payments or direct POS payments for more convenience.
Also, we could either implement the system to be a complete POS for the restaurant or integrate it with the current POS system they have as a digital channel (based on the complexity, I prefer to only integrate with them)

And maybe we can take advantage of self-serving restaurants

So the customer journey would be like:

- A customer walks into a restaurant for Dine-In
- Either they have the app already, or asked to install it, or Scan a QR code that opens a web link for that specific restaurant branch (Depends on what are we going with, Mobile or web app)
- they select the table number, and make their order
- and either checkout with TNBC cryptocurrency or normally through POS

OR

- A customer makes his order through the app/Web for take away
- completes the payment
- and just goes to the restaurant to pick up his order


#### What problem does it solve?

- No more waiting in lines
- Cryptocurrency payments
- instead of every restaurant having their own system, and paper/Tablet menus, any customer will be able to browse the menu on their own devices.

#### Who is the target market?
Restaurants and Cafes

#### What do you think is the opportunity of this project?
It might make life easier and reduce waiting time for customers, and reduce cost on restaurants 

#### How does it integrate with thenewboston digital currency work?
direct payments from customers

#### Are there any competitors?
i don't think so

#### Will you need specific information or advice?
for sure i will need more help once we start the project

#### What are your goals and objectives?
- To make a centric system for all the restaurants and cafes
- To make a value of TNBC

#### How will you evaluate project success?
By number of restaurants and cafes enrolled with us

#### What risks should you plan to manage?
Integrations with the existing POS systems, convincing restaurants owners of using the system
