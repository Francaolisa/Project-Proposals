#### Issue

https://github.com/thenewboston-developers/Project-Proposals/issues/104

#### How would you describe your project?
An exchange made specifically to trade TNB for other crypto currencies and real money a bit later on. No accounts or registration, just simple trading!

#### What problem does it solve?
Varied/inconsistent exchange rates, potentially unsafe manual trading.

#### Who is the target market?
Buyers and sellers of TNB coins.

#### What do you think is the opportunity of this project?
Stabilise the exchange rate, provide a safe, simple, easy and reliable platform to acquire or sell TNB.

#### How does it integrate with thenewboston digital currency work?
This exchange is specifically made for TNB.

We will provide an API to convert TNB coins into other currencies that various stakeholders are more interested in. For instance, restaurant owners accepting TNB may be more interested in holding USD.

We will create a global market for TNB coins. Investors will have 24/7 access to a fair exchange rate and developers will have the option of swapping some of their coins for legal tender.

#### Are there any competitors?
Nope. This helps everyone :-)

#### Will you need specific information or advice?
Any and all input is welcome!

#### What are your goals and objectives?
Create, maintain and improve the exchange.

#### How will you evaluate project success?
What level of liquidity do we offer?
Do we support the assets that people want to exchange with TNB?

#### What risks should you plan to manage?
Security & Reliability:
